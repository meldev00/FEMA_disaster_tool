## Problem Statement

In the event of a disaster, it is essential for goverment and private forces to rapidly identify potential threats and communicate effectively about damage and rescue efforts if needed. FEMA has developed a list of seven life-lines that are deemed essential to successfully address the most pressing issues with the most clarity across the board. Using these seven life-lines as search criteria, this study was conducted for New Light Technologies with two goals:

  - to predict where the largest threat is to the life-lines prior to a disaster
  - build a tool that takes in a zip code and returns the potential impact of a disaster to the lifelines
